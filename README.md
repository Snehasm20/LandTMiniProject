A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library. Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset collections as well as relationships with their members. Library management systems help libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as membersâ€™ subscriptions and profiles.This is a application using C programming language. we can do basic library management task like adding the book, view the added book, search the books etc. This application based on structures and file handling in C, where I have used a file-related function like fopen, fread, fwrite, ..etc
